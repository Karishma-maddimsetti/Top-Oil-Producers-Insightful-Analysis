# üåç Top Crude Producers Insightful Analysis - Power BI Dashboard

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive and interactive visualization of global crude oil production trends. It highlights key oil-producing countries, annual production changes, regional comparisons, and performance metrics using dynamic charts, maps, and KPIs.


## üìä Project Overview

This dashboard answers key business questions such as:

* Who are the top crude oil producers globally?
* How has production trended over recent years?
* What is the regional contribution to global oil output?
* Which country had the highest drop in production?


## üîß Tools & Technologies Used

* **Power BI Desktop**
* **Excel (for raw data input)**
* **DAX** for calculated metrics and KPIs


## üìÅ Dataset Features

* **Country**: Name of the oil-producing country
* **Production (Mb/d)**: Daily oil production in thousand barrels
* **Yearly Share (%)**: Contribution to global production
* **Region**: Geographical region (e.g., North America, Asia-Pacific)
* **YoY Change (%)**: Year-over-year production growth or decline


## üß© Dashboard Pages

1. **Top Producers Overview**

* Highlights top oil-producing countries like the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia.
